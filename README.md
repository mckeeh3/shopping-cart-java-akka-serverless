# shopping-cart-java-akka-serverless

This project is an Akka Serverless service that demonstrates a simple shopping cart implemented as an Akka Serverless service.
The project contains two shopping cart implementations. One implementation has a shopping cart component as a value entity.
The second shopping cart implementation has a shopping cart component as an event sourced entity.
Both shopping cart implementation have a functionally equivalent API.

## Designing

While designing your service it is useful to read [designing services](https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/akka-serverless/services/development-process.html)


## Developing

This project has a bare-bones skeleton service ready to go, but in order to adapt and
extend it it may be useful to read up on [developing services](https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/akka-serverless/developing/index.html)
and in particular the [Java section](https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/akka-serverless/java-services/index.html)


## Building

You can use Maven to build your project, which will also take care of
generating code based on the `.proto` definitions:

```
mvn compile
```


## Running Locally

In order to run your application locally, you must run the Akka Serverless proxy. The included `docker-compose` file contains the configuration required to run the proxy for a locally running application.
It also contains the configuration to start a local Google Pub/Sub emulator that the Akka Serverless proxy will connect to.
To start the proxy, run the following command from this directory:


```
docker-compose up
```


> On Linux this requires Docker 20.10 or later (https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/40007),
> or for a `USER_FUNCTION_HOST` environment variable to be set manually.

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.linux.yml up
```

To start the application locally, the `exec-maven-plugin` is used. Use the following command:

```
mvn compile exec:exec
```

With both the proxy and your application running, any defined endpoints should be available at `http://localhost:9000`. In addition to the defined gRPC interface, each method has a corresponding HTTP endpoint. Unless configured otherwise (see [Transcoding HTTP](https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/akka-serverless/java/proto.html#_transcoding_http)), this endpoint accepts POST requests at the path `/[package].[entity name]/[method]`. For example, using `curl`:

```
> curl -XPOST -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:9000/io.example.CounterService/GetCurrentCounter -d '{"counterId": "foo"}'
The command handler for `GetCurrentCounter` is not implemented, yet
```

For example, using [`grpcurl`](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl):

```shell
> grpcurl -plaintext -d '{"counterId": "foo"}' localhost:9000 io.example.CounterService/GetCurrentCounter 
ERROR:
  Code: Unknown
  Message: The command handler for `GetCurrentCounter` is not implemented, yet
```

> Note: The failure is to be expected if you have not yet provided an implementation of `GetCurrentCounter` in
> your entity.


## Deploying

To deploy your service, install the `akkasls` CLI as documented in
[Setting up a local development environment](https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/akka-serverless/setting-up/)
and configure a Docker Registry to upload your docker image to.

You will need to update the `dockerImage` property in the `pom.xml` and refer to
[Configuring registries](https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/akka-serverless/projects/container-registries.html)
for more information on how to make your docker image available to Akka Serverless.

Finally you can or use the [Akka Serverless Console](https://console.akkaserverless.com)
to create a project and then deploy your service into the project either by using `mvn deploy`,
through the `akkasls` CLI or via the web interface. When using `mvn deploy`, Maven will also
conveniently package and publish your docker image prior to deployment.
